# Traffic-Management-SNA
Using network analysis, here I am trying to solve problem of traffic by recommending where and how to develop city.

∗ Developed a detailed dataset of vehicular movement using Open Street Map and SUMO simulation software to analyze
traffic dynamics.
∗ Identified gaps in existing traffic datasets and created a custom dataset to capture critical traffic details.
∗ Simulated realistic traffic scenarios and converted the data into CSV format for comprehensive analysis.
∗ Analyzed traffic patterns to identify congestion hotspots and underlying factors contributing to traffic jams.
∗ Provided informed recommendations for infrastructure improvements and traffic management strategies to enhance urban
transportation systems.
